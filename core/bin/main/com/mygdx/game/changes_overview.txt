All changes by files:

Body interface:
slightly changed according to new way of getting objects(getName() replaced with getId())


celestialBody class:
field name is not used anymore.

id is now used to represent which body do we work with

setLocation and setVelocity now also accept vectors


PhysicsUtils class:
all fields with properties are removed. Now only SystemProperties instance of these arrays are used

rewrote updateVelocity and updateLocation methods a little bit(logically they are the same as before, just written in a different way)

distanceToTitan method moved to a Probe class

updateBody method renamed to calculateNextState


Probe class:
name field is not used anymore

now id is used to identify probe among others Body objects(all probes have the same id which is specified as a constant in SystemProperties)

new field titanReached introduced

now each time we update location of a probe it also updates distanceToTitan with help of updateDistanceToTitan method

method displayData introduced. It prints all necessary information about the probe


SimulationLogic class:
timeCounter removed

functionality of timeCounter is now implemented in Timer class

new field minDistanceToTitan introduce to save best distance to titan

if-else statement where we decide to stop simulation is reduced to one block now

applyNewState method introduced(which updates current state of all planets to the next state) - thanks to this feature bug I described in whatsapp is fixed (now we actually use values only from one state at the same time)

moveCamera method is renamed to moveCameraToProbe


SystemInitializer class:
class which I created to add all planets to our system. Now it uses constant ids from SystemProperties to specify planet type


SystemProperties class:
hashmap entities removed
now different constants contain different ids of different planets which makes it easier to receive index of a planet and thus easier to get planet instances from SolarSystem.planets arraylist

next states of coordinates and velocities are moved here. Now they initially store zero-vectors

Timer class:

new class which is now used instead of counter. Information about its methods can be found in comments of the code
